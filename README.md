### [RottenTomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/justice_league_2017)<br> 



Build a regression model that can accurately predict the gap between the average audience rating and the average critic rating for a movie

- You will train your model on data collected from rottentomatoes. You can collect as much data as you want.

- Your model will be tested on a separate dataset that you will not have access to. This testing set will also be collected from rottentomatoes.

- Your model can utilize any features that you think can explain the rating gap.
